In order to \"regularize\" their homes, otherwise they will face eviction and demolition.", "Security forces used tear gas, batons, birdshot and live ammunition to disperse the protests, which were largely peaceful, according to Amnesty International and what several videos showed on social media.", "Security forces also killed at least two men, Aweys al-Rawi in Luxor and Sami Bashir in Giza.", "Authorities arrested hundreds of protesters and bystanders last month, as they did in 2019.", "The independent Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms has documented the arrest of 944 people in 21 governorates, of whom at least 72 are children, some of whom are less than 11 years old, and the real number may be much higher.", "Public Prosecutor Hamada al-Sawy said on September 27 that he had released 68 children who were detained in what he described as \"riots.\"", "Most of those arrested were charged with the usual charges such as demonstrating without government permission, calling for unauthorized protests, joining a terrorist group, spreading false news, and misusing social media.", "The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms and other organizations said that security forces disappeared dozens of detainees for days and held them in unofficial detention sites before presenting them to the prosecution.", "The mass arrests and the violent response to the protests, seven years after the government of President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi eliminated virtually all forms of political and civic participation, show how fearful the authorities are about popular protests.", "What these demonstrations also show is that Egyptians refuse to declare their human rights waived even though they live under a government that makes clinging to those rights extremely costly.", "As the tenth anniversary of the January 2011 revolution approaches, the September protests should remind the government that repression does not necessarily guarantee stability."]
