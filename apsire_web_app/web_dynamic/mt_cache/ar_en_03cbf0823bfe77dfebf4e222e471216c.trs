["The polio program is accelerating response efforts to the new polio outbreak in Sudan and Yemen", "From Dr. Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean", "Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa", "Amman / Cairo, 11 September 2020: \u201cThe mutated polio cases that were recently confirmed in Yemen and Sudan are a consequence of the increasingly low levels of immunity among children.", "Each wave of the outbreak left children paralyzed in areas where it was extremely difficult, if not impossible, to provide them with a routine or supplemental polio vaccine, and to be deprived of it for long periods of time.", "\u201cThe outbreaks were not entirely surprising.", "In Sudan, the intense community movement, the movement of people displaced by the conflict, the frequent population movement between neighboring countries, and the restricted access to certain areas made it difficult to provide every child with vaccinations.", "In Yemen, cases are gathering in the war-torn Saada governorate in the northwest, which suffers from extremely low levels of routine vaccination, in addition to the polio eradication program that has not reached it for more than two years.", "The last domestic roving vaccination campaign in this region occurred nearly two years ago, in November 2018.", "Polio is a devastating contagious disease, and it is transmitted from person to person through close contact.", "The only way to stop it is by vaccinating a person with the oral polio vaccine.", "The outbreak of a mutated poliovirus is a wake-up call that immunity levels in affected communities are becoming unacceptably low.", "\u201cFor WHO, UNICEF, governments and partners in these two countries, the occurrence of these outbreaks threatens the decades-long progress in the polio program.", "Sudan witnessed the last case of polio in 2009, while Yemen witnessed the last case in 2005.", "Both countries have worked hard since then to maintain immunity levels through the widespread use of OPV, but what new outbreaks indicate is that we need to do a lot more.", "\u201cPoor immunity against all strains of the poliovirus is an increased risk across the region, due to the ongoing challenges in delivering life-saving vaccines to children.", "The \"Covid-19\" pandemic led to a further decrease in vaccination rates, which exacerbated the difficulties in providing health care caused by political instability and armed conflict.", "Children in areas affected by polio outbreaks very seriously need other basic health and nutrition services.", "Once we can plan a campaign against polio, we must seize the opportunity to benefit parents and children together by providing additional health services, from water, sanitation and hygiene services to vitamin A and deworming tablets, to protection from other vaccine-preventable diseases.", "For example, the Yemeni governorate of Saada is currently experiencing an outbreak of measles.", "Providing a range of additional health services along with treatment for polio is an easy and logical way to save more lives.", "\"The outbreaks of polio in Sudan and Yemen are the first new cases of polio during the\" Covid-19 \"period in our region.", "In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, WHO is also responding to the outbreak of mutated polioviruses in Somalia, Afghanistan and Pakistan.", "And we know very well that by combining the efforts of national authorities, local communities, and polio partners to work together, we can stem the outbreak - just as we did in Syria in 2018.", "But if we cannot vaccinate every child in all parts of these regions with the life-saving vaccine, we fear that more countries will witness the tragedy of having children paralyzed throughout their lives due to a disease that can - and should - be stopped.", "\u201cWHO and UNICEF are fully committed, and join together, to rid the world of this debilitating disease.", "We call on all those concerned, especially the parties to the conflict and those with influence over them, to facilitate unimpeded and sustainable humanitarian access to health workers so that they can provide every child with the polio vaccine.", "Polio anywhere is a threat to children everywhere.", "\"Today, more than ever, there is an urgent need to support routine vaccination efforts and provide every child with the oral polio vaccine, which is the best tool the world has to stop the spread of polio.\"", "Notes to editors:", "\u2022 There are several strains of polio, and there is a basic difference between the naturally occurring poliovirus, which we find today only in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the mutated poliovirus.", "\u2022 The name \"mutated poliovirus\" may be misleading: the problem is not with the oral polio vaccine, but rather low levels of immunity.", "\u2022 The oral polio vaccine contains a small amount of the poliovirus (attenuated vaccine virus) that induces an immune response in children.", "This is what makes it highly effective.", "But sometimes, over time, when the vaccine virus passes through children's bodies, it can turn into a harmful form of the poliovirus, causing paralysis.", "If all the children in the area are adequately vaccinated, this virus will not find anyone to infect, and the virus will die on its own.", "But if immunity levels are consistently and severely low, children may develop an infection that paralyzes them - and this is what happened in Sudan and Yemen.", "This two-minute animation shows how the mutated polio virus spreads:", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg_XFQ2zib4"]
