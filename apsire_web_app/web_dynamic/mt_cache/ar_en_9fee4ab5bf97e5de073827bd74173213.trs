["\u201cPop music humanizes Uighur hopes\u201d: an interview with musicologist Elise Anderson", "An expert on Uighur language and music, Anderson has spent years in Xinjiang", "Translation posted on October 1 - October 2020 5:57 GMT", "Read this article in Fran\u00e7ais, Espa\u00f1ol, English", "A concert with Uyghur musician (who holds the guitar) Farhat Khadik from the Qatq band.", "Screenshot from a YouTube video.", "In many societies that suffer from oppression and social rejection, music is often the only space and form of resistance.", "This applies to the 11 million Uighurs in western China, and to the thousands who have been forced to flee their homeland.", "To understand how music can become a major source of visibility, I spoke to Elise Anderson, an expert in Uighur language and music, who spent years in Xinjiang and is a senior program officer with the Uyghur Human Rights Project.", "The interview has been edited for brevity", "Philip Noble: Dance and music have become a cultural battlefield between the Uighurs and the state.", "Did you explain why?", "Translate the original text", "Elise Anderson: Over the past few decades, Uyghur music has been a means of political resistance and at the same time a form of entertainment and artistic expression, as well as a source of spiritual nourishment, and a subject of the institutionalization of the state.", "To some extent, the Chinese state has had a pivotal role in shaping Uyghur music: over the past seven decades, Uyghur artists and producers have had to operate within the strict limits of what censorship allows.", "However, Uyghur musicians have long used metaphor and symbolism to broadcast political messages through their music.", "While these messages seemed clearer in the 1990s, when Koresh Kosen sang \"Don't Sell Your Land\" to Uyghur farmers, the state's hard-line responses to political opposition since the late 1990s have argued that Uyghur artists should be more creative.", "Even more recently, in 2015 and 2016, these messages appeared on stage and in recordings, as Uyghur artists sang about \"home\" and \"the people.\"", "These encrypted messages seem to have disappeared since 2016.", "The Chinese state has long stereotyped oppressed peoples like the Uyghurs as \"musicians.\"", "A plus of the stereotypes is that it has allowed musical spaces to flourish as a platform for expression, making theater performances a rare space in the semi-civil society of Uyghurs.", "The negative consequence of these stereotypes is that they have often transformed Uighur music into vulgar and superficial versions, and Uighurs are reluctant to make their own music to some extent.", "We recently saw this in videos from state-run social media accounts sharing videos of Uyghur singing and dancing - as if the singing and dancing are Uyghurs by nature or somehow disprove the reality of China's oppression.", "Many Uyghur diaspora find these images extremely problematic and offensive.", "Philip Noble: Your focus is on Uighur pop music.", "Did you explain to us its source, method of performance and publication?", "Translate the original text", "From the beginning, the focus of my academic research and performance has been on what we might think of as \u201ctraditional\u201d or \u201cclassical\u201d music, a genre known as \u201cAli Maqam Aki\u201d [The Twelve Maqamat].", "However, from the very first moment I became acquainted with Uyghur music, I also found myself drawn to popular idioms.", "Uyghur music has diverse influences, some of which link it to Uyghur music as a whole.", "For example, the popular repertoire, which includes thousands of songs with hilarious lyrics and often rhyming, continues to be a source of content for pop music performed and favored at weddings and nightclubs.", "The technical aspects and melodic characteristics of the maqam also have a similar effect in the melodic overtones of some pop music, and there is much intersection between the musicians performing across genres and styles.", "But \u201cworld\u201d pop music has long been the inspiration for Uyghur pop music, with influences from Uzbekistan, Turkey and other countries to the western Uyghur region.", "Other sources of influence are perhaps less perceptible: flamenco, reggae, vocalists, K-pop, jazz and rap.", "The processes of borrowing and merging began in earnest with the arrival of cassette technology in the region in the 1990s and then accelerated in the first decade of the twenty-first century and 2010, especially since the Internet helped audio and video to make their way around the world quickly and easily.", "We can say that Uyghur pop music is, at least for some of its practitioners, a universal practice.", "Here is an example of a Uyghur rock singer, Berhat Khaliq, who sings under the name Kitik in the Uyghur language but also in Kazakh and mixes different styles of music:", "Philip Noble: Some Uyghur singers and musicians are worshiped.", "While some are allowed to play and officially sell their music, others are in exile, self-censorship, or detained.", "Can you give us some examples and what they represent in the eyes of the Uyghurs?", "Translate the original text", "Elise Anderson: Undoubtedly, Abdullah Abd al-Rahim ranks among the highest in worship among all Uyghur pop artists.", "Abdullah who is a professor at Al-Buraq, the central melodic decoration of the aesthetics of Uyghur music, has been performing since the 1990s.", "Although he doesn't seem to have performed much over the past few years, he's released some new music and recently broadcast an entire concert via Douyin, the local Chinese version of Tik Tok.", "Abd al-Rahim Hayet, singer, songwriter, and dutar player (a two-stringed long-necked oud), is not equally liked but perhaps more respected.", "Abdel Rahim was arrested by the authorities in early 2017.", "In February 2019, after a rumor spread from Turkey that he had died in custody, the Chinese authorities responded to the international protest by distributing a video proving he was still alive.", "Sanobar Tursun, who is also a popular singer-songwriter and dotarist, also disappeared in custody.", "We no longer hear about her in 2018, when he was due to perform a string of concerts in Europe.", "The authorities in China have neither confirmed nor denied her detention, despite international pressure.", "Sanobar, who has studied at the Shanghai Conservatory and has collaborated extensively with Chinese and international artists, is back in public performances in Urumqi in late 2019.", "Countless beloved musicians have also disappeared, including but not limited to Barida Mamout, Rashida Daut, and Ablajan Awt Ayoub.", "At another time, self-censorship was a sad thing.", "I have seen examples of Uyghur musicians \u201cexpressing their loyalty\u201d by putting political words in Chinese to Uighur-style melodies, singing entire songs praising Xi Jinping, and writing articles in support of the party.", "Live concerts, which actually declined significantly after 2014, are almost non-existent.", "Of course, Uyghur musicians in the diaspora have performed outside of China.", "A notable example is Koresh Kosen, who lived in Sweden, and a fatal sultan, a Uyghur who grew up in Uzbekistan and moved to the United States.", "In recent years, musicians have formed teams in Australia and Europe, and young Uyghurs have performed rap and other styles of music around the world.", "Performers are also active in Central Asia, where large Uighur communities have long existed: Sanyam Ismail (Kazakhstan) and Nzugum Ayubova (Uzbekistan) immediately come to mind.", "Philip Noble: Since the Uyghur culture and language is being systematically attacked by the Chinese state, what role can Uyghur pop music play today?", "Translate the original text", "Elise Anderson: Uyghur pop music can play several roles as culture continues to be attacked: as a medium of expression and production in the Uyghur language.", "While the space devoted to the Uyghur language in formal education has shrunk dramatically to the point where it is still only a symbolic gesture, it appears that musicians have continued to produce music in the Uyghur language.", "The environment in which they make that music is changing, and the censorship conditions I mentioned above pose difficulties, but the language is still alive.", "Pop music can also go on to play roles as a source of entertainment and a rich inner life.", "This is extremely important for the millions of Uyghurs who experience unimaginable trauma.", "This point applies to the Uyghur diaspora as much as it does to the Uyghurs back home.", "Another role that pop music can play is to humanize and amplify Uyghurs' hopes, aspirations and lives.", "Increasingly, I am convinced that we are so caught up in arguing about the exact number of detainees that we forget the devastated human lives in this crisis.", "Pop music can give us ways to understand that life and find out who Uighurs are and how they aspire to be a part of the world.", "Likewise, pop music can also help us see that Uyghurs are much more than just lucky people in songs and dancing in Chinese stereotypes.", "Being Uighur can mean many different things, and the diverse influences and contents of Uyghur pop reveal some of these differences."]
