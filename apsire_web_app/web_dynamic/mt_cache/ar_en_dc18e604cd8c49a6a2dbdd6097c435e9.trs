["The Emirati-Israeli Achievement: Bilateral and Regional Implications and American Policy", "On September 14, The Washington Institute held a hypothetical policy forum with Ibtisam Al Ketbi, Dori Gold, Barbara Lev and David Makovsky.", "Al Ketbi is the founder and president of the Emirates Policy Center, the leading foreign policy and security research center in the United Arab Emirates.", "Gold is the president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs and a former Israeli permanent representative to the United Nations.", "Woolf is the Institute's \"Lapidus Fellow\" and a former US ambassador to the Emirates.", "Makovsky is the Institute's Distinguished \"Ziegler\" Fellow and former Senior Adviser to the US State Department's Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations.", "The following is a assessed summary of their remarks. \"", "Ibtisam Al Ketbi", "The \"Abraham Agreement\" represents a new chapter in the history of the Middle East, as it reflects the structural changes that the region has witnessed in the past decade.", "The UAE\u2019s decision to normalize relations with Israel came as a result of the facts on the ground, which include the absence of occupied territories to negotiate and no history between the two countries on the battlefield.", "The normalization was based on real cooperation that serves the interests of the two countries and on the desire to establish a new security system.", "It is a peace based on options, not necessity.", "Bahrain followed the example of the UAE, and other countries will follow, given that normalization will enhance stability and prosperity.", "The regional dynamics that precipitated the agreement include changes in the distribution of power in the Arab world - the states that were at the center of this power are being transferred to the parties and vice versa.", "The treaty also has repercussions that extend beyond Israeli-Emirati ties to other Gulf states, South Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean.", "It is imperative for both parties to the treaty to work together to design strategies compatible with their interests, including issues of security, the military, the economy, technology, medicine and agriculture.", "They can also collaborate to effectively deal with non-traditional threats such as food security, cybersecurity, and COVID-19.", "The UAE\u2019s decision was partly influenced by the changing US strategic assessment for the region, which includes the \"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\" regarding the Iranian nuclear program and the Obama administration's declared policy on focusing on Asia.", "The countries of the \"Gulf Cooperation Council\" and their allies felt forgotten when they were not consulted on the \"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\"", "Under the \"Abraham Agreement\", the United States will commit a grave mistake if it deals with the agreement on the \"hit-and-run\" manner and does not maintain its commitment to the region.", "The UAE has taken a bold step and has been condemned by the Arab street, the Palestinians, and Qatar, which is one of the closest partners of the United States.", "If Washington wants normalization to continue and spread in the region, it must help pave the way for each party to join.", "The other obstacle that Arab countries face is Israel's hostility towards the Palestinians, which is an obstacle for any country that wishes to join this circle of stability.", "In terms of domestic reaction, while the older Emirati generation has grown up on the narrative that Israel is an enemy, the younger generation has a different view.", "The UAE has 200 nationalities and has realized how to ensure their peaceful coexistence together.", "It should be noted that the \"Abraham Agreement\" is not a spur of the moment. There was a long period during which relations between Israel and the UAE developed, which included reciprocal ministerial visits, sports activities and the existence of the Abrahamic Family House dedicated to religious tolerance.", "Finally, the UAE is now leaning towards moderate Islam, knowing that it was never a closed society in terms of social freedoms or tolerance.", "Gold League", "The \"Abraham Agreement\" is a turning point in the Middle East.", "The UAE has become an important power not only in the Arabian Gulf, but also in the Horn of Africa.", "Israel is located in the same geographic region, which creates many areas for cooperation.", "The two countries can leverage their alliance with the United States to shape their responses to the Iranian threat.", "The Emiratis are very enthusiastic about this achievement, something Israel can certainly appreciate given that its former peace partners did not feel the same.", "In turn, Israel will support its peace partners in Washington, as it did with the Jordanians.", "The \"Abraham Agreement\" creates new potential security structures for the Middle East in the future.", "Israel\u2019s current situation is similar to that of Europe at the end of World War II, when the United States was planning to withdraw and Russia would fill the vacuum.", "In response, the United States formed NATO.", "Security structures are of great importance in light of the changes in the region, and partners can help design a different Middle East based on stable actors.", "Israel also has a legitimate case for its qualitative military superiority, but it is not against the Emiratis.", "And if Israel suddenly decides to wait on the issue of \"qualitative military superiority\", the final impact will be reflected on other Arab countries that have not signed peace with Israel and may seek to exploit this decline in terms of \"qualitative military superiority.\"", "With regard to the Palestinians, the main factor is whether they are willing to consider reasonable proposals.", "President Mahmoud Abbas was not ready to reach an agreement before the end of Obama's term, and the situation remains as it is today.", "Since the days of Israeli strategist Yigal Allon, it has been widely accepted that Israel will keep certain parts of the West Bank and some lands will be returned.", "And when Israel agreed to Trump's peace plan, it accepted the division of territories stipulated in the proposal as suitable for the future.", "Israel has an opportunity to cooperate with its Arab partner countries on how to take advantage of normalization in order to influence the distribution of land in any peace settlement with the Palestinians.", "For example, the Palestinians need an arrangement to increase their GDP; Perhaps new regional partnerships could facilitate truck and train routes from Haifa to the West Bank, via Jordan, to the Gulf.", "The Palestinians would benefit financially from their land as a conduit for trade.", "It is important to consider the way peace interacts between Israel and the Arab countries to produce better outcomes for the region.", "Barbara Lev", "On the local Emirati scene, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed has taken a series of steps in the past decade to promote the distinct sense of Emirati nationalism, especially among the youth.", "These initiatives reflected concerns that modern lifestyles are beginning to affect the country's small community, that the state is losing its culture, and that the younger generation lacks a sense of responsibility towards the state.", "Moreover, the leadership of the UAE was experiencing a state of normalization - both among its own people and in the region.", "The Emirati media coverage of Israel was also not emotional, and while the leadership took a cautious approach to the public appearances of the Israeli delegation when Abu Dhabi began hosting meetings of the United Nations International Renewable Energy Agency in 2015, increasing and deliberate importance was given to individual communications.", "The aim of these steps was to make the UAE\u2019s position unique in the region in the eyes of the United States and its people alike.", "After 2011, the unrest continued unabated, with two quasi-blocs forming in the region - Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt on one side; And Qatar, Iran, Turkey, and rejectionist groups such as the \"Muslim Brotherhood\", \"Hamas\" and \"Hezbollah\", on the other hand.", "While the normalization was based on national security factors for the Emirates, the Emiratis also considered an essential step in order to strengthen ties with the United States, maintain bipartisan support in Washington, and upgrade the relationship to the special \"club\" of strategic partners such as Israel, in addition to reaching Some of the advanced defense systems they always wanted to have.", "There is also a kind of thinking among the leadership of the Emirates that the region is moving into a post-American era.", "In this regard, the agreement can be viewed as a hedge against this possibility, as the UAE seeks a defense / security relationship with the superpower in the region, i.e. Israel.", "The Emirati foreign policy is often risky; The strategic move towards normalizing relations with Israel was a carefully considered risk, and it accelerated a trend that was already evident.", "In parallel, Washington has been struggling for some time about how to deal with a bolder Emirati foreign policy, and the Democratic US presidential administration is likely to play a more important role.", "It is reported that the UAE tried more aggressive interventions in Yemen and Libya.", "In Yemen, the costs have become so high that the crown prince made the difficult decision to withdraw, despite the costs to the UAE-Saudi relationship.", "For its part, Libya is an example of the UAE extending its hands away, which will likely affect the congressional decision to sell F-35 fighter jets and other advanced systems to Abu Dhabi.", "The current US administration or any future administration will be mistaken if it focuses exclusively on achieving more gains from normalization. This risks normalization on a largely transactional basis, which would cause a conflict with other policies such as \"qualitative military superiority\".", "The question that arises for the United States is how to strategically build on the accomplishments that have already been achieved, and ultimately move towards resolving the Palestinian issue, which is the primary factor for Israeli and Palestinian security and prosperity.", "The best thing now is to respect the official reservation of other countries for the time being, with an emphasis on encouraging partners in the region to do what the UAE started a few years ago - that is, change the environment in the country to prepare its people for formal normalization at some point.", "This means lifting restrictions on communications at the individual level, strengthening interfaith dialogue, changing the tone of the governmental media towards Israel and working in general to change the local environment so that normalization does not remain an unthinkable idea at all.", "David Makovsky", "There is a convincing bilateral justification for the Emirati-Israeli agreement.", "The two countries are wary of Iran and have clear views on the JCPOA and political Islam.", "This rapprochement is especially important amid longstanding questions about the US role in the region.", "The agreement also facilitates the achievement of potential economic prosperity.", "While the Israeli peace with Egypt and Jordan was of great strategic importance, peace with the UAE offers investment opportunities.", "The normalization agreement also offers a warm peace that Israel has never seen before.", "The agreement is the result of an unintended multi-stage peace process.", "First came the Trump peace plan, which the Palestinians immediately rejected.", "In addition, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not been able to motivate the Israeli right wing because he has not accustomed his base to the idea of ceding territories.", "Hence the possibility of annexing the West Bank lands, which was rejected due to international outrage and opposition from the strategic community in Israel itself.", "Third, the UAE came to the rescue of the United States and Israel mainly through the normalization agreement.", "The agreement is a great achievement, although it did not require the same level of risk that Menachem Begin took at Camp David or Yitzhak Rabin in Oslo.", "The UAE seized a tactical moment to take advantage of bilateral security benefits from the United States, as President Trump faced tough elections and sought to achieve an achievement.", "It is also likely that the UAE viewed this move as an insurance against the political risks of a possible post-Trump era, as the democratic administration may have different views on the Gulf.", "As for the Palestinians, the parties should reconsider the Arab peace initiative, which was based on foundations that were valid in 2002, when the Gulf states did not have bilateral relations with Israel.", "The idea of Arab states normalizing relations after Israel resolves its conflict with the Palestinians was a reward, but now, it is viewed as punishment - a position that would postpone relations with Israel indefinitely and at a very high cost in terms of alternative opportunities given the threat posed by influence. Iranian in the region.", "Among the indications of changing views was that when the Camp David Accord was reached in 1979, the Arab League severed its relations with Egypt for ten years.", "But last week, the \"League\" simply indicated that the UAE agreement was a sovereign decision of an Arab country and that it would not intervene in this regard.", "And while the Palestinians will certainly await the results of the US elections, they should try to curry favor with the Emirates rather than cursing the decision.", "They have a lot of disputes with the Emirates that need to be resolved, and they are often exacerbated by the rivalry between Abbas and the prominent Palestinian politician residing in the Emirates, Muhammad Dahlan.", "Finally, it is important to note that while many US officials have made trips to the region in the context of the Israeli-Emirati achievement, Pentagon officials have not taken similar steps.", "Any deal to sell F-35 fighter jets will require negotiations between the two communities on defense matters, but their times are not synchronized now, even as the Trump and Netanyahu administration press for a solution to this issue by the end of this year.", "This summary was prepared by Basia Rosenbaum.", "The Policy Forum series of programs were made possible thanks to the generosity of the \"Florence and Robert Kaufman Family\"."]
