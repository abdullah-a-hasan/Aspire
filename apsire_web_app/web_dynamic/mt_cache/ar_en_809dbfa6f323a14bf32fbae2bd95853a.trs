hosting major entertainment, cultural and sporting events as a deliberate strategy to divert attention from its image as a country committing rampant violations, Human Rights Watch said today.", "On October 2, 2020, Human Rights Watch launched a global campaign to counter the Saudi government's efforts to polish its disgraceful human rights record.", "The two years since the brutal killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in October 2018 have seen no accountability for the high-ranking officials involved in the murder.", "Since then, the government of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has aggressively organized and financed high-profile events involving top artists, celebrities and international athletes, and has plans for more.", "Saudi Arabia also currently holds the presidency of the \"G-20\", a forum for international economic cooperation, and will host the G20 leaders' summit in late November.", "\"Citizens and residents of Saudi Arabia should enjoy first-class recreational and sporting events, but they should also enjoy basic rights such as freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,\" said Michael Page, deputy director of the Middle East division at Human Rights Watch.", "So, when a group of Hollywood stars, international athletes, and other international celebrities receive government money to perform in Saudi Arabia, while they are silent on the government's human rights record, they reinforce a strategy to polish the violations of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.", "Investing in major entertainment, cultural and sporting events is linked to Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s plan, \u201cVision 2030\u201d, which aims to reform the country's economy and attract foreign investors and tourists.", "One of the programs developed by the plan creates more entertainment options in order to create a \"positive image of the Kingdom at the international level.\"", "Under Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia has invested heavily in creating a local entertainment industry and attracting top talent from around the world.", "In May 2016, the plan established the General Entertainment Authority with plans to invest $ 64 billion in music, entertainment, sports, art, and cinema, among others.", "The ministries of sports, tourism and culture are also involved.", "Those who have performed since 2018 include: Enrique Iglesias, Mariah Carey, Andrea Bocelli, Janet

Formula 1 race starting in 2023.", "Human Rights Watch said that such incidents could be used to counter critical scrutiny of the Saudi government's human rights violations, including the Khashoggi killing, and undermine efforts to hold Saudi officials accountable.", "Mohammed bin Salman adopted the establishment of the entertainment sector in conjunction with developments in favor of women and youth.", "Although these changes are broad and important, they have also helped obscure a significant reduction in civil and political rights since Mohammed bin Salman assumed the mandate of the Covenant in 2017.", "While the nascent entertainment sector was gaining international praise, Saudi authorities were simultaneously carrying out waves of arbitrary arrests of dissidents, activists, intellectuals, and members of the royal family.", "Likewise, promoting Saudi cultural and social life helped avoid scrutiny of its role in the armed conflict in Yemen.", "Under Mohammed bin Salman's leadership as Defense Minister, since 2015 the Saudi-led coalition has bombed homes, markets, schools, hospitals, and mosques in unlawful attacks that have killed hundreds of civilians, some of which may amount to war crimes.", "Human Rights Watch will seek to counter Saudi efforts to polish up its violations through a campaign to educate the entertainment and sports sectors of Saudi Arabia's human rights record, including top celebrities, performers, and sports figures.", "The campaign will also seek to communicate with organizers and participants in major international events sponsored by the Saudi government, and invite them to speak out publicly about rights issues, or not to participate when polishing its human rights record is its primary purpose.", "Since Khashoggi's murder, a number of celebrities and influencers on social media have refused to travel to Saudi Arabia, citing its appalling human rights record.", "Among them: Nicki Minaj, Emily Ratajkowski, Martha Hunt, John

sovereign wealth fund.", "Page said, \"The Saudi government has done everything in its power over the past two years to bury the killing of Jamal Khashoggi under sporting shows and events.", "Until there is real accountability for these and other crimes committed by the Saudi leadership, those silently benefiting from the kingdom's generosity risk complicity in polishing up Saudi violations. \"", "\"Business\" polishing the image", "Reputation enhancement is a formidable business.", "In it, PR firms explicitly sell the promise of improved reputations, but many other business relationships, particularly those involving prominent artists, athletes, and politicians, offer valuable reputational benefits.", "Governments have long recognized the importance of the soft power of PR firms and celebrities in shaping perceptions about their policies.", "While this power can be used for beneficial ends, such as promoting tourism or local products, leaders turning to PR firms or celebrities to polish their poor human rights records can divert efforts to hold them accountable for these violations.", "The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights call on business to take appropriate action to identify and mitigate human rights risks related to their activities.", "These due process measures must include the reputational risk of governments, companies, or individuals responsible for ongoing or recent serious human rights violations.", "Credible due diligence should assess whether the company's customer or an affiliate of the event in which it is involved is engaged in abusive activity, assess the risks of the company's relationship with any reputational polishing violations, and develop a strategy to mitigate these risks.", "The reputation polishing process can take many forms, including cases in which the business relationship involves significant risks to cover up, justify or deny specific rights violations, or undermine accountability efforts.", "An event can be considered a \"polishing of reputation\" if it is part of a deliberate effort to divert attention from specific human rights violations.", "Companies should not intentionally enter into a business relationship whose sole or primary purpose is to deny or cover up human rights violations, in line with their human rights responsibilities under the UN Guiding Principles.", "When the business relationship is often for another purpose, but there is a risk of reputation polishing as a result of that relationship, the company should strive to mitigate this impact.", "This can be done by speaking out about the violations that this business relationship risks helping to hide.", "Businesses should also refrain from activities that would enhance the reputation of entities or government officials who have recently and reliably been accused of committing serious violations.", "Finally, companies should not agree to any explicit or implicit contractual terms that restrict their ability to speak out publicly or privately about such violations, as they are separate from the standard requirements of confidentiality.", "Saudi efforts to enhance its image", "The Saudi government has realized that hosting celebrities and major international entertainment and sporting events is a powerful way to polish its reputation and convince international investors to invest in the country despite widespread human rights violations.", "The government has already poured hundreds of millions of dollars into this strategy, aiming to offset the scale with the scrutiny and reporting processes carried out by human rights organizations and local human rights activists.", "But expanding entertainment options for Saudi citizens and increasing tolerance for different types of artistic expression do not compensate for the decline in civil and political rights during the same period.", "The Vision 2030 plan explicitly outlined the Kingdom's strategies regarding the development of public entertainment activities, which are committed to activating \"the role of government funds in contributing to the establishment and development of entertainment centers ...
