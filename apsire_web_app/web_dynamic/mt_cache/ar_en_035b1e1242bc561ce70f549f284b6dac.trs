Sucrose is extracted from sugar beet and sugar cane, and is widely used as a sweetener.", "Polysaccharides are found in the tissues of most plants, but are present in a concentration sufficient for their highly efficient extraction only in sugarcane, sugar beet and sugarcane that have been cultivated in hot regions of South Asia and Southeast Asia since ancient times.", "A major expansion of its production occurred in the eighteenth century with the establishment of sugarcane plantations in the West Indies and the Americas.", "And this was the first time that sugar became available to the public and who had previously relied on honey to sweeten foods.", "Sugar production changed the course of human history in many ways, and affected the formation of colonies, the continuation of slavery, the transition to forced labor, migration of peoples, wars between nations to control the proportion of sugar in trade in the nineteenth century, and the demographics and political structure of the new world.", "The world produced about 168 million tons of sugar in 2011.", "The average person consumes about 24 kg of sugar annually (33.1 kg in industrialized countries), which equates to more than 260 food calories per person per day.", "Historically sugar industry [edit]", "Sugar in antiquity [edit]", "The sugarcane plant was known since the eighth millennium BC on the banks of the Bay of Bengal and then spread to the surrounding areas (Indonesia - Malaysia - Indochina - South China).", "Since the year 327 BC.", "The soldiers of Alexander the Macedonian supervised the sugar cane plantations in India and benefited from the experience of the local people in the age of the cane plant and the juice condensation and crystallization, but it was used as a treatment and not food.", "Sugar in the Middle Ages and the Agricultural Revolution in the Islamic State [edit]", "Then the Arabs knew sugar in its image at that time as a sticky, semi-crystalline paste with medicinal benefits.", "The first sugar refineries were built, which improved product quality.", "Sugar was known to Europe in its modern concept from contact with the Islamic civilization in Sicily, Cyprus and Andalusia in the eighth and ninth centuries AD.", "The first known record of sugar in the English language was in the late thirteenth century when the Crusader knights were returning to their country with what they called \"sweet salt\", describing it as \"the most valuable and important commodity for human use and health.\"", "The phase of diffusion in Europe [edit]", "Since the Middle Ages, sugar has been a cornerstone of the European economies as an expensive commodity not manufactured locally, around which monopoly and trade conflicts revolve.", "Later, Venice, which was importing sugar as a final product from Alexandria, was able to manufacture sugar from imported raw materials and established a monopoly on the sugar trade in Europe, but this monopoly did not last long. Where explorers from Portugal at the beginning of the sixteenth century were able to return from India carrying sweet-tasting gold to become the capital of the sugar industry in Europe in that century.", "Then sugar reached the French market, and during the reign of Louis XIV sugar could be bought by the pound.", "By the 18th century, sugar was within the reach of Europe's upper and middle classes.", "The sugar industry in Europe was associated with the slave trade because they are cheap labor that bears the hardship of this industry, which requires great effort, due to its connection to the hot climate and the difficulty of transporting raw materials due to its weight and methods of age and condensation, so Africa was the magic solution for European aristocrats as the first source of slaves for the sugar industry in a scene similar to the situation of slaves Those who were brought to America for exploitation in the cultivation of cotton after several centuries.", "Phase of mass production and transfer of industry to the Americas [edit]", "In 1493 AD, Christopher Columbus, during his second voyage, transported the sugar cane plant to the new continent.", "But industrially, sugar production started from cane for the first time in 1747 AD in the United States of America.", "In the seventeenth century, the sugar industry remained more prosperous in the new continent, as raw sugar was produced there and then shipped by sea to Europe for refining and then consumption.", "At the same time, a German scientist was able to obtain sucrose (white sugar) from sugar beet, whose cultivation was transferred to Europe during the Crusades from the Levant - his original home - in which he was grown to prepare salads.", "Food sugar [edit]", "Table sugar is a common term referring to the substance whose scientific name is sucrose, and it is man's favorite substance for sweetening.", "Sugar is extracted mainly from sugar cane in hot regions of the world, it is also extracted from sugar beets in the cold northern regions, in addition to the presence of types of fructose that are also used for sweetening and making various sweets.", "Sugar should be handled with caution as sugar is prohibited for diabetics in particular.", "Modern manufacturing process and its stages [edit]", "Although the beginning of the modern manufacturing process of sugar was in the eighteenth century, but this industry witnessed a strong boom in the previous decades with the development of modern electronic control technology that allowed the establishment of medium-labor production lines that operate with high efficiency to allow for mass production inexpensively with a small loss rate, as well. It is a clean process that does not pollute the environment or emits carbon dioxide, which also provides a large amount of by-products resulting from the refining process and used in many other applications such as making fodder, molasses, kohl, white vinegar, fermentation materials, fertilizer ... etc.", "The following are the stages of manufacturing:", "After the reed or beets are weighed and a sample is taken to analyze the quality of the crop, the crop passes in the production line on the washing stage, cutting and slicing until the plant turns into a fibrous material and its heart full of sucrose appears.", "Pairs of rollers feed the cut reeds on belts into a series of mills. Each mill consists of three large rollers arranged in a triangular shape, and the reeds are milled twice in each mill.", "And recently, the diffusion method has been applied to extract the juice, whereby the juice is spread in the water to be pumped in the mills, leaving a semi-dry fibrous material that is used as animal feed or as fuel for boilers or in the manufacture of paper.", "The raw leachate is treated by adding heat and lime to remove impurities and mud, and the clear leachate is poured out.", "The muddy leachate is purified under low pressure, then the leachate is recycled and the mud is used as fertilizer for farmland.", "The leachate is condensed by evaporating most of the water at low pressure in a series of connected vessels called \"evaporators\".", "Note: Water boils at a lower temperature under low pressure, so heat and product quality are saved. The leachate (70% of which is now solid) is boiled under low pressure, but in huge containers until the juice is concentrated to the desired degree, and the crystals of the specified size are released with the remaining from water.", "The mixture of crystals and water is administered in centrifuges to isolate the crystals.", "And take the black liquid surrounding the crystals to be boiled and repeat this process twice to get the best result.", "This residual liquid is used to make alcohol.", "Raw sugar is dried by passing it in a stream of warm air, then cooled with dry air until it is bottled.", "Types of sugar [edit]", "Brown sugar: white sugar with molasses: (a brownish-black solution produced by refining sugar cane and beet sugar).", "Cane sugar: taken from cane.", "Fructose: Sugar that is naturally found in fruits.", "Barley sugar: It is obtained from barley.", "Beetroot: Sugar that is obtained from beets.", "Castor sugar: These are crystals of white sugar.", "Date sugar: It is the sugar that is produced from dates.", "Food sugar", "Also called fulose, it is one of the artificial sugars and the sweetest of all types of natural sugars (including maltose, sucrose and corn).", "It is a natural sugars found in fruits, honey and some plants.", "Producing countries [edit]", "The five largest sugar producers in the world in 2011 are Brazil, India, the European Union, China, and Thailand.", "The largest sugar exporting countries in the same year are Brazil, followed by Thailand, Australia, and India much later.", "The largest importers of sugar are the European Union, the United States of America, and Indonesia.", "Photo gallery [edit]", "References [edit]", "^ (PDF) https://web.archive.org/web/20130312023134/http://@fas.usda.gov/htp/sugar/2011/Nov2011sugar.pdf.", "Archived from the original (PDF) on March 12, 2013.", "Sources [edit]", "Lapedes Daniel ed.", "McGraw Hill Encyclopedia of Food, Agriculture and Nutrition.", "McGraw Hill, 1977.", "Marc Aronson, Marina Budhos, Sugar Changed the World: A Story of Magic, Spice, Slavery, Freedom, and Science November 2010", "Abbott, Elizabeth (2009) [2008].", "Sugar: A Bittersweet History.", "London and New York: Duckworth Overlook", "Hugot, E.
