["The death of the Emir of Kuwait leaves the country vulnerable to rivals in the Gulf", "The death of Prince Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah was not unexpected - unfortunately, the Kuwaiti leader had been ill for several months and was recently transferred to a hospital in the United States.", "His successor will be his half-brother, Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, but the newly appointed 83-year-old emir also suffers from an unconfirmed health condition and has not been active in politics or government.", "Thus, speculation will quickly turn to the crown prince who will choose him.", "It is reported that before Sheikh Sabah assumed power in 2006, the role of the Emir was more symbolic, as the crown prince took over the daily affairs of government.", "And if his death revives this model, sooner rather than later the role of the crown prince could become essential.", "Unlike other Arab monarchies in the Gulf, the ruling Sabah family in Kuwait is not prominent and has to in practice share power with other leading families and a tumultuous parliament.", "Consequently, the National Assembly must approve the selection of the new emir to succeed him at some point during the next year - and perhaps not until the next National Assembly is elected in November.", "The most likely candidate for crown prince is the 72-year-old son of the late Emir, Defense Minister Nasser Al-Sabah.", "But he may face competition from his longtime rival, Ahmed Al-Fahad Al-Sabah.", "Another development is that the Kuwaiti leadership used to move between the Jaber and Salem branches of the Al Sabah clan.", "But this tradition was broken in 2006, when Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem was appointed as ruler for a short period but was then deemed ineligible to take the oath to take up the position.", "In a unanimous vote, the National Assembly recommended that he abdicate in favor of Sheikh Sabah.", "It should be noted that the new emir and the two most likely candidates to succeed him, Sheikh Nasser and Ahmed, all hail from the Jaber branch, so this trend of breaking traditions may continue.", "The regional complications abound as well.", "The unrest in neighboring Iraq is a constant source of concern for Kuwaitis, since Saddam Hussein's invasion of the country in 1990 remains firmly in their collective memory.", "They also worry about the proximity of Iran, which is only a few miles across the Gulf and shares some of Kuwait's offshore oil fields.", "Hydrocarbon resources are a subject of contention with Saudi Arabia as well - since the two countries have shared the oil-rich \"neutral zone\" on the coast, and the resulting market competition has sometimes caused tensions.", "In 2017, Prince Sabah hosted the Saudi crown prince and de facto ruler of the kingdom, Mohammed bin Salman, in Kuwait, but that strange meeting with a member of the much younger royal family ended abruptly and the two did not meet together again.", "The main legacy that Prince Sabah will leave is likely to be his reputation for trying to mediate Gulf disputes, although his failed attempts in recent years have outnumbered his successes.", "More recently, he sought to bridge the rift between Qatar and the four countries, Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which had boycotted Doha for more than 3 years.", "As for US policy, Kuwait has always been a steadfast and grateful ally of the United States, especially since the expulsion of Iraqi forces in 1991.", "It returned the favor by securing many facilities for the US army, including the headquarters of the \"Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve /\" Operation Inherent Resolve \", which involves permitting strikes from Kuwaiti bases against the targets of the\" Islamic State \"in Iraq and Syria. .", "Such cooperation is likely to continue, although a few months of uncertainty may loom in the near term as the new emir asserts himself as ruler and sets the direction of his rule for the next term.", "Finally, although Kuwait is a country synonymous with oil wealth, it has witnessed economic hardship in recent times due to lower oil prices and lower production.", "Therefore, competitors in the region may consider that the time has come to sow the seeds of political exploitation, perhaps by interfering with rivalries within the Al Sabah clan or the National Assembly."]
