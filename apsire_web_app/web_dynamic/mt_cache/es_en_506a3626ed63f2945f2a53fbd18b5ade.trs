["Burns", "A burn is an injury to the skin or other organic tissue caused primarily by heat or radiation, radioactivity, electricity, friction, or contact with chemicals.", "Thermal burns (caused by heat) occur when some or all cells in the skin or other tissues are destroyed by:", "hot liquids (scalds);", "hot solid objects (contact burns);", "flames (flame burns).", "The problem", "Burns are a global public health problem, causing around 180,000 deaths a year, most of which occur in low- and middle-income countries, and nearly two-thirds in the African and Asian regions Southeastern WHO.", "In many high-income countries, burn death rates have been declining, and the infant mortality rate is now more than seven times higher in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.", "Non-fatal burns are a leading cause of morbidity, including prolonged hospitalization, disfigurement, and disability, often leading to stigmatization and rejection.", "Burns are among the leading causes of loss of disability-adjusted life years in low- and middle-income countries.", "In 2004, nearly 11 million people around the world were burned badly enough to require medical attention.", "Facts about some countries", "In India, more than 1 million people suffer moderate or severe burns every year.", "In Bangladesh, nearly 173,000 children suffer moderate or severe burns each year.", "In Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt and Pakistan, 17% of children with burns are temporarily disabled and 18% are permanently disabled.", "Burns are the second most common cause of injury in rural Nepal, causing 5% of disabilities.", "In 2008, more than 410,000 burn injuries occurred in the United States of America, of which 40,000 required hospitalization.", "Economic impact", "In 2000, direct costs of caring for children with burns in the United States of America exceeded $ 211 million.", "In Norway, the costs of hospital management of burns in 2007 exceeded 10.5 million euros.", "In South Africa, about US $ 26 million is allocated each year to treat burns from incidents with the use of kerosene (paraffin) stoves.", "Indirect costs, such as lost wages, prolonged care for deformities and emotional trauma, as well as the use of family resources, also contribute to the socioeconomic impact.", "Who is at risk?", "According to sex", "According to the most recent data, burn death rates are slightly higher in women than in men.", "This is in contrast to the common injury pattern, where injury rates tend to be higher among men than women.", "Women are more exposed to the risk associated with cooking outdoors or using dangerous stoves that can compromise clothing.", "Open flames used for heating and lighting also carry risks; self-inflicted or interpersonal violence is another factor (although it is not studied enough).", "According to age", "Along with adult women, children are especially vulnerable to burns.", "Burns are the fifth most common cause of non-fatal childhood injuries.", "While one of the greatest risks is inadequate parental supervision, a significant number of burn injuries suffered by children are due to child abuse.", "Regional factors", "There are important regional differences between burn rates.", "The incidence of burn deaths is more than two times higher among children under five in the WHO Africa region than among children under five in the rest of the world.", "Men under the age of five living in the low- and middle-income countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region are almost twice as likely to die from burns than men in the WHO European region.", "The incidence of burn injuries requiring medical attention is almost 20 times higher in the WHO Western Pacific region than in the Americas region.", "Socioeconomic factors", "People living in low- and middle-income countries are at greater risk of burns than those living in high-income countries.", "However, within all countries the risk of burns is correlated with socioeconomic status.", "Other risk factors", "There are other risk factors for burns, namely:", "occupations involving exposure to fire;", "poverty, overcrowding and lack of adequate security measures;", "household chores, such as cooking or babysitting, entrusted to little girls;", "underlying health problems, such as epilepsy, peripheral neuropathies, and physical and cognitive disabilities;", "excessive alcohol consumption and smoking;", "easy access to chemicals used in acts of violence (such as acid);", "the use of kerosene (paraffin) as a fuel source for non-electrical household appliances;", "inadequate safety measures for liquefied petroleum gas and electricity.", "In what contexts do burns occur?", "Burns occur mostly in the home and workplace.", "Community surveys in Bangladesh and Ethiopia show that between 80% and 90% of burns occur in the home.", "Children and women often suffer burns in the kitchen, caused by containers containing hot liquids or flames, or by explosions of appliances.", "Men are more prone to burns in the workplace (fires, scalds, chemicals, and electricity).", "Prevention", "Burns are preventable.", "High-income countries have made considerable progress in reducing burn death rates by combining preventive strategies with better care for those affected.", "Most of these advances in prevention and care have not been fully implemented in low- and middle-income countries.", "If efforts in this direction were intensified, the rates of death and disability related to burns would be significantly reduced.", "Prevention strategies should address the hazards associated with burn injuries, education for vulnerable populations, and training communities in first aid.", "An effective burn prevention plan should be multisectoral and include broad initiatives aimed at:", "generate greater awareness;", "develop effective policies and enforce them;", "describe the burden of the problem and identify risk factors;", "set research priorities and promote promising interventions;", "offer burn prevention programs;", "strengthen burn care;", "strengthen capacities to carry out all of the above.", "Seven components are discussed in detail in the WHO plan for burn prevention and care.", "In addition, several specific recommendations are made for individuals, communities, and public health officials aimed at reducing the risk of burns:", "enclose fires and limit the height of open flames in the domestic environment;", "promote the use of safer stoves and less dangerous fuels and provide information on the use of clothing that can catch fire;", "apply safety standards to housing design and materials, and encourage home inspections;", "improve the design of kitchens, especially in relation to stability and prevention of access by children;", "reduce the temperature at the hot water taps;", "promote education on fire safety and the use of smoke detectors, sprinklers and emergency exits in homes;", "promote the adoption of industrial safety standards and their compliance, and the use of flame retardant fabrics for children's sleepwear;", "do not smoke in bed and encourage the use of lighters with child safety devices;", "promote laws that mandate the production of cigarettes designed to reduce the risk of fire;", "improve the treatment of epilepsy, especially in developing countries;", "encourage further development of burn care systems, including training health care providers in the proper triage and management of people with burns;", "support the manufacture and distribution of fire retardant aprons to be used when cooking over an open fire or with a kerosene stove.", "First aid", "Here are some basic guidelines on first aid for treating burns:", "What is to be done", "stop the burning process by removing clothes and hydrating the affected parts;", "extinguish the flames by rolling the person on the floor or covering them with a blanket, or by using water or other liquids that help put out the fire;", "use cool running water to reduce the temperature of the burn;", "in case of chemical burns, remove or dilute the chemical agent by irrigating with large amounts of water;", "wrap the patient in a clean cloth or sheet and transport to the nearest appropriate facility for medical attention.", "What should not be done", "do not start giving first aid before ensuring your own safety (switch off the electrical current, wear protective gloves against chemicals, etc.);", "do not apply ointments, oil, or haldi (turmeric) to the burn, or use raw cotton on it;", "do not apply ice, as it will only deepen the injury;", "avoid prolonged cooling with water, as this will cause hypothermia;", "do not break the blisters until they can be treated with antibiotic ointments by a healthcare provider;", "avoid direct contact of the wound with any type of tissue, as this could lead to infection;", "do not apply any type of topical medication until the patient has received proper medical attention.", "WHO response", "WHO promotes interventions that have been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of burns.", "Within this framework, the Organization supports the creation and use of a global burn registry to collect unified global data on burns.", "It also encourages greater collaboration between national and global networks to increase the number of effective burn prevention programs."]
