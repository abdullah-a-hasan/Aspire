chemicals and electricity in the workplace.", "prevention", "Burns can be prevented.", "By combining prevention strategies with improved medical care for burn patients, high-income countries have made great progress in reducing burn mortality.", "Most prevention and medical advances are not fully applied in low- and middle-income countries.", "If further efforts are made in this area, the burn mortality and disability rate can be greatly reduced.", "Prevention strategies should emphasize the hazards of various burns, educate high-risk groups, and carry out community first aid training.",
