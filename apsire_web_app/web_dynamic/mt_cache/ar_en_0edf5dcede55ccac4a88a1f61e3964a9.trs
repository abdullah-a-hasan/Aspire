severe burns annually.", "In Bangladesh, about 173,000 children suffer moderate or severe burns annually.", "In Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, and Pakistan, 17% of children with burns have a temporary disability and 18% of them have a permanent disability.", "Burns are the second most common injury in rural Nepal, accounting for 5% of disabilities.", "In 2008, more than 410,000 burn injuries were recorded in the USA, and nearly 40,000 of them required hospital treatment.", "Economic impact", "In 2000, the direct costs of caring for children with burns in the USA exceeded $ 211 million.", "In Norway, the costs of treating burns in hospitals exceeded 10.5 million euros in 2007.", "In South Africa, it is estimated that approximately $ 26 million is spent annually caring for burns caused by accidents caused by kerosene (paraffin) stoves.", "Indirect costs, such as lost wages, extended care for distortions, emotional trauma, and spending of family resources, also contribute to the social and economic impact.", "Who are at risk?", "By gender", "According to the latest data, the death rates from burns are slightly higher in females compared to males, and this is in contrast to what is usual in other injuries, where these rates are higher in males compared to females.", "The biggest risk for females is cooking with open burning or inherently unsafe cooking stoves, which can burn loose clothing.", "An open flame used for heating and lighting also carries risks, and intrinsic violence or violence between individuals are two other risk factors (although they have not been sufficiently studied).", "By age", "Children are at particular risk of developing burns, as are adult women.", "Burns are the fifth most common cause of non-fatal childhood injuries.", "While one of the main risks is adults' failure to supervise children, no", "Regional factors", "There are large differences in burn rates regionally.", "The mortality rate of children under the age of five due to burns is twice as high in the countries of the WHO African Region as in other regions of the world.", "Children under the age of five living in low- and middle-income countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region are about twice as likely to die as those in the WHO European Region.", "The incidence of burn injuries requiring medical attention is about 20 times higher in the WHO Western Pacific Region than in the WHO Region of the Americas.", "Socio-economic factors", "People who live in low and middle income countries are more likely to suffer from burns than people who live in high income countries.", "However, the risk of developing burns is linked to socioeconomic status in all countries.", "Other risk factors", "There are a number of other risk factors for a burn, including:", "Occupations that increase fire risk;", "Poverty, overcrowding and lack of adequate safety measures;", "Assign young girls to household tasks, such as cooking and caring for young children;", "Underlying health conditions, including epilepsy, peripheral neuropathy, and physical and cognitive impairments;", "Excessive alcohol abuse and smoking", "Ease of obtaining chemicals used in attacks (such as acid)", "Use kerosene (paraffin) as fuel to run non-electrical household appliances;", "Insufficient safety measures taken when using LPG and electricity.", "Where do burns occur?", "Burns mainly occur at home and in the workplace.", "Some community surveys in both Bangladesh and Ethiopia show that 80 to 90 percent of burns occur at home.", "Children and women often get burns in the kitchen from dropping or burning hot liquids or exploding cooking stoves.", "Men are more likely to suffer burns in the workplace from fires, scalds, chemicals, and electricity.", "protection", "Burns are preventable injuries.", "High-income countries have made significant progress in reducing burn deaths, thanks to implementing a range of preventive strategies and improving burn care.", "However, the bulk of this progress in prevention and care has only partially included low- and middle-income countries.", "Further efforts in this area are likely to lead to a significant reduction in death and disability rates from burns.", "Preventive strategies should enable treatment of a specific set of burn injury risks, education of vulnerable populations, and training of communities in first aid.", "To be effective, a burn prevention plan should be multisectoral and include broad efforts to:", "Improving awareness", "Effective policy development and enforcement", "Describe the burden and identify risk factors", "Prioritizing research, while encouraging promising interventions", "Provide programs aimed at preventing burns", "Enhancing burn care", "Enhancing capacity to implement the aforementioned measures", "The document, entitled The WHO Burn Prevention and Care Plan, discusses these seven elements in detail.", "In addition, the following are a number of specific recommendations aimed at reducing the risk of burns for individuals, communities, and public health officials:", "Contain open flames and reduce their height in domestic environments.", "Encouraging the use of safer cooking stoves and less hazardous fuels, and education on wearing loose-fitting clothing.", "Applying safety systems to housing designs and materials used in their construction, and encouraging home inspections.", "Improving the design of cooking stoves, especially with regard to their stability and preventing children from accessing them.", "Reducing the temperature in hot water faucets.", "Encourage education in the field of fire safety and the use of smoke detectors, sprinklers used in extinguishing the fire, and fire escape systems in homes.", "Encouraging adoption and compliance with industrial safety regulations, and the use of fire-resistant fabrics in children's pajamas.", "Avoid smoking in bed and encourage the use of child-friendly lighters.", "Encourage legislation mandating the production of fire-free cigarettes.", "Improving epilepsy treatment, especially in developing countries.", "Encouraging further development of burn care systems, including training of health-care providers in the appropriate triage and management of burns.", "Support the manufacture and distribution of fireproof aprons for use during cooking by means of an open flame stove or kerosene burner.", "first aid", "Here are basic tips for first aid in the event of a burn.", "What to do", "Stop the burning process by removing the clothing and spraying the burns with water.", "Extinguishing the flame by enabling the injured person to roll on the ground or covering him with a blanket, or by using water or any other liquid that enables the fire to be extinguished.", "Use cold tap water to reduce the burning temperature.", "In the case of chemical burns, the chemical agent is removed or diluted by spraying the burn site with large quantities of water.", "Wrap the patient in a clean cloth or blanket and take them to the nearest medical care facility.", "What should not be done", "Failure to initiate first aid measures before personal safety is guaranteed (switching off the electrical current, wearing gloves in case of chemicals, etc.).", "Do not apply paste, oil, turmeric, or raw cotton to the site of burning.", "Not using ice because it deepens the injury.", "Avoid cooling the burn site with water for a long time, as this will cause hypothermia.", "Do not open the blisters unless a topical antimicrobial has been
