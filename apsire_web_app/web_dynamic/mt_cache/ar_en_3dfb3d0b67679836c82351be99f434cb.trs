["US officials mediate maritime border talks between Israel and Lebanon", "After nearly a decade of relentless diplomatic efforts, the United States has succeeded in brokering an agreement between Israel and Lebanon to start formal negotiations on demarcating the maritime border between them.", "Barring a last-minute change in Beirut\u2019s position, talks are scheduled to begin in early October after the end of the Jewish holidays.", "Under the auspices of an American delegation, representatives of the two countries will meet at the headquarters of the \"United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon\" (\"UNIFIL\") in Naqoura.", "A UN rapporteur will also attend the sessions at Lebanon\u2019s insistence, but his remarks will not be submitted to the United Nations due to Israeli objection.", "The breakthrough was achieved after US Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker visited Jerusalem and Beirut earlier this month.", "To overcome the continuing differences between the two parties regarding the legal basis and form of negotiations, the US government sent side letters in which it offered guarantees to both countries.", "One of the outstanding problems relates to the possibility of linking maritime decisions and the final demarcation of the land borders between them, especially with regard to the small area that Israel calls Mount Dov, near the Shebaa Farms on the slopes of Mount Hermon.", "Originally, Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz was authorized to inform Lebanon that its government was prepared to divide the 860 square kilometers of disputed maritime land, at a ratio of 42:58 in favor of Beirut.", "The Lebanese are looking to the French company \"Total\" to start drilling operations in \"Block No. 9\" adjacent to the disputed area, while Israel is preparing international tenders in the adjacent \"Alon D\" block.", "Click on the map for a larger version.", "The main spokesman for the Lebanese side in this process is the Shiite Muslim Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, who acted with the approval of President Michel Aoun, presumably also with the tacit approval of Hezbollah.", "It is likely that the financial collapse in Lebanon led to the acceleration of preparatory efforts for the US State Department.", "On the other hand, Israeli officials believe that once the demarcation line is approved and Lebanon begins drilling for natural gas, the risk to Israeli offshore gas platforms will be greatly diminished.", "While Egypt and Jordan have cooperated with Israel on gas projects for some time, dealing with Lebanon has posed a dilemma.", "The challenges of maritime borders are of both a legal and geological nature.", "The first normal condition is agreement on the land borders in order to determine their meeting place with the sea.", "In this case, however, the relevant (dividing) boundary point - \u201cRosh Hanikra\u201d / \u201cRas al-Naqura\u201d - is still a technically contested area that ends with a steep white cliff without a beach.", "Moreover, while neighboring Cyprus has an agreed maritime border with Israel, its attempts to reach a similar agreement with Lebanon have been hampered by Turkish pressure on Beirut.", "In response, unhappy Nicosia decided to demarcate its borders with Israel from the south side of the line it had hoped to draw with Lebanon.", "From Beirut\u2019s point of view, the so-called \"triple point\" at which the exclusive economic zones of the three countries meet lies further south.", "Thus, this disputed part of the land will be discussed during the upcoming talks.", "Israel has not yet explored the disputed area, but the nearby exploration in the south has added optimism to the possibility of hydrocarbon resource reservoirs in commercial quantities deep in the seabed.", "Although such reservoirs may end up bypassing any maritime limits that may be reached during the coming weeks, these complications arise in many places around the world, and there are legal models for joint exploitation.", "Given the poor financial situation in Lebanon, the talks are good news for the country because the agreed borders could benefit the economy in the long run.", "However, these benefits may be nullified if Hezbollah is allowed to maintain its current access to most key ministries in Lebanon, because the party and its allies will undoubtedly benefit from any oil and gas revenues.", "On the one hand, then, it is important to protect the maritime border demarcation agreement from US pressure related to the political reform process in Lebanon.", "On the other hand, it is imperative that Washington understands that the corrupt political class will only benefit from the agreement unless serious changes are made to Lebanon's political structure - which means support for early elections and the enactment of a new electoral law, as well as implementing the reforms stipulated during the Paris meeting in Last December and also recently.", "Hezbollah has always been able to buy time when it is besieged.", "With sanctions piling up against the party, its local allies and Iran, some observers in Lebanon fear that the maritime talks will be just the last attempt to derail any meaningful reforms and freeze further external pressure.", "Therefore, Washington must continue its efforts to impose sanctions on members of the corrupt political class and to show the Lebanese people that this deal is in their interest and not in the interest of the \"Hezbollah\" axis.", "Finally, it is important to note that the impetus for a possible maritime agreement is not part of the recent process of normalization between Israel and other Arab countries.", "From the point of view of Hezbollah and the current Lebanese government, the demarcation of the maritime borders will not reflect any change in their stance towards Israel or the land borders of the \"Blue Line\" drawn by the United Nations in the aftermath of the July 2006 war.", "Nevertheless, it may remove at least one danger: that any future confrontation with Hezbollah will necessarily affect Israel's offshore gas fields.", "Ehud Yaari is a \"Lafer International Fellow\" at The Washington Institute and a seasoned commentator on Israeli television.", "Simon Henderson is the Institute's \"Baker Fellow\" and director of the Bernstein Program on Gulf Affairs and Energy Policy.", "Hanin Ghaddar is a Friedman Fellow in The Geduld Program on Arab Politics."]
