Irbid-Amman highway and three GMC cars followed him, surrounded his car [to prevent him from driving], put a bag on his head and arrested him.", "He was treated very unethically. \"", "A lawyer representing the union said that he was at the union's headquarters in Amman when the police raided the building.", "He said he demanded to see the judicial order imposing the closure, but the police refused to show it.", "He said, \u201cI told them this was illegal and I would need a court order to allow them [to close the office].", "I told them if you show me the matter, I will let you do whatever you want, otherwise everything you do is illegal. \"", "The lawyer, who was present when the detainees appeared before the prosecution, added that the basis for the arrests appears to be \"cybercrimes\" resulting from their social media posts.", "He said he believed the catalyst for the closings and arrests was a document the union published on July 13 that outlines the union's plan to recoup the bonuses negotiated in 2019.", "The steps involved a series of intermediary measures that eventually led to another strike.", "In addition to the 13 union council members who were arrested on July 25, union members provided Human Rights Watch with lists of names of dozens of other members who were subsequently arrested by the police.", "A union member said that the police had

of July 29.", "Human Rights Watch said the blanket ban on government employees participating in protests or strikes violates their rights to freedom of expression and assembly, and their labor rights.", "The Jordanian authorities should immediately clarify all the details about the arrests, the closure of the union, the reversal of the closure, and the release of the detainees if there is no legal basis to support the arrests.", "The authorities should stop the methods of intimidation and blanket bans that prevent people from participating in protests and strikes, and from exercising their right to freedom of association.", "\u201cThe government\u2019s takeover of a trade union, in addition to the brutal crackdown, is a disturbing development that shows the extent to which the Jordanian government lacks self-confidence when faced with any opposition,\u201d Page said."]
