["India: Women are at risk of sexual assault in the workplace", "(New York) - The Indian government's failure to properly implement its sexual harassment law leaves millions of women in the workplace vulnerable to abuse without a remedy, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.", "The government should urgently ensure compliance with the 2013 Law on Sexual Harassment of Women in the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redress), or POSH as it is widely known.", "The 56-page report, titled \"There is no #MeToo Like Us Women: Weak Enforcement of Sexual Harassment Law in India,\" found that while women in India increasingly speak out about sexual assault in the workplace, this is partly due to the #MeToo movement (#MeToo) Global Many, especially in the informal sector, remain constrained by stigma, fear of retaliation and institutional barriers to justice.", "Central and local governments failed to strengthen, establish, and monitor complaints committees, a key feature of the law, to receive sexual harassment complaints, conduct investigations, and recommend action against abusers.", "\u201cThe #MeToo movement has helped shine a spotlight on violence and harassment in the workplace, but the experiences of millions of women in the informal sector in India remain absent,\u201d said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch.", "India has progressive laws to protect women from sexual assault by superiors, colleagues, and clients, but has failed to take simple steps to enforce these laws.", "Human Rights Watch conducted field research and more than 85 interviews in Tamil Nadu, Haryana, and Delhi, including with women working in the formal and informal sectors, union officials, women's rights and employment activists, lawyers, and academics.", "The results are also based on research conducted by Indian organizations.", "Women, who have lodged complaints against men in senior positions, and who were inspired by the global #MeToo movement, often faced violent reactions, including threats, intimidation, retaliation, attempts at bribes, gaps and bias in legal process, and stigma.", "Defendants frequently used colonial-era criminal defamation law against women who dared to speak out.", "This has a frightening effect that prevents other victims from speaking.", "The alleged mass rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh in September 2020 highlighted the rampant violence against women in India and the structural violence against poor and marginalized communities.", "The authorities' response explains the barriers women face in accessing justice.", "The vast majority of female workers in India, 95% (195 million), work in the informal sector.", "Jobs include street vendors, housework, farming, construction, and working from home, such as weaving or embroidery.", "There are also 2.6 million early childhood care and nutrition workers under the government's \"Integrated Child Development Services\" program; More than one million female workers in the \"Certified Social Health Worker\" (Asha) program are working as community health workers; And 2.5 million chefs for lunch who prepare the free lunches served in public schools.", "A part-time domestic worker who was sexually harassed by a security guard said, \u201cFor women like me, what does #MeToo mean?", "Poverty and stigma mean we can never speak out.", "There is no safe place for women like us. \"", "The 2013 Workplace Harassment Law requires employers to take steps to protect female employees from sexual harassment in the workplace and provide procedures for dissolution, settlement, or prosecution.", "The law expanded the definition of the workplace and included the informal sector, including domestic workers.", "The law protects all female employees in any place they visit while working, including transportation.", "The law builds on the Supreme Court's 1997 \"Vishaka Guidelines\" that require employers to take steps to protect female employees from sexual harassment in the workplace after Banwari Devi, a government social worker, was gang-raped in 1992 by men angered by her efforts to stop marriage Children in their families.", "The law requires employers to establish an \"internal committee\" in every office with ten or more employees.", "For other enterprises with fewer than ten employees and women working in the informal sector, the law requires a local official in the state government to form a \"local committee\" in each district.", "These committees handle complaints and recommend procedures ranging from a written apology to termination of services, providing an alternative to filing a criminal complaint with the police.", "By law, the government is also responsible for developing training and educational materials, organizing awareness programs, monitoring law enforcement, and maintaining data on the number of sexual harassment cases filed that have been resolved in the workplace.", "But studies show that many of these local committees do not exist, and when they do, there is no publicly available information on how to access their services.", "\u201cMost women suffer in silence until the situation becomes unbearable, and then they try to get another job,\u201d said Sonia George, a senior trade union official.", "They do not tell their families because they are afraid to prevent them from working. \"", "Domestic workers are at particular risk of sexual harassment and violence due to their isolation in private homes and their exclusion from many of the main labor protections guaranteed to other workers.", "For domestic workers, the law provides that local committees must refer the case to the police, leaving no avenue for civil redress.", "The Indian government should amend the law to ensure that domestic workers obtain the same access to time-bound justice as other workers, Human Rights Watch said, through local committees.", "While most private sector companies have internal committees, many of these exist on paper only to demonstrate compliance without any commitment to improving a workplace culture.", "Employers do little to fulfill their other duties, such as preventing harassment, raising awareness about what constitutes sexual harassment, and the consequences of such behavior.", "In both the formal and informal sectors, the government should establish effective committee monitoring systems and publish regular reports to ensure transparency and accountability.", "The government should establish local committees at each level of local government to ensure easy access and regular training for committee members, district judges, and other relevant provincial officials.", "In June 2019, the Indian government, representatives of Indian workers 'groups and representatives of employers' associations voted in favor of the International Labor Organization Convention on the Elimination of Violence

Labor Organization treaty and fully implement the Workplace Harassment of Women Act, Human Rights Watch said.", "\u201cThe Indian government should defend the rights of women to work in safety and dignity, whether they are domestic workers, government employees or office workers,\u201d Ganguly said.", "The government should coordinate with labor organizations and human rights groups to address sexual harassment and violence as a major issue in the workplace, and it should participate in media campaigns, and ensure that those facing abuse receive the support and compensation they are entitled to.", "Examples from the report", "Shanta (name changed), is a health worker", "Shanta, 38, a health worker in Asha, Haryana state, said female health workers are especially at risk when

them, so I kept quiet.", "This guy used to say to me, \"Put on a short dress, you look better.\"", "I put up with it because I had to earn money to support my family.", "But I eventually quit because

husband that I wanted to go back to the village.", "My husband and brother went to the compound and complained to the head of security they knew, and the guard was quietly transferred.", "If the employers knew, they would be more likely to blame me.", "That is why I remained silent.", "For women like me, what does #MeToo mean?", "Poverty and stigma mean we cannot speak out.", "There is no safe place for women like us.", "Neither our workplace, our homes, nor the road we travel."]
