However, people with multiple system atrophy are less likely to tremor at rest than people with Parkinson's disease.", "Words are difficult to pronounce, and the pitch of the voice may rise and be accompanied by shivering.", "Lack of coordination may also occur.", "It is caused by degeneration of the cerebellum.", "Patients lose their balance.", "Later on, they may not be able to control the movements of their arms and legs.", "In doing so, they have difficulty walking, and make wide and irregular strides.", "When they reach something, they may skip it.", "They may feel unsteady when sitting.", "People may find it difficult to focus their eyes on and track objects.", "Tasks that require rapidly alternating movements, such as opening a door handle or installing a light bulb, also become difficult.", "Also, the internal body processes that control the autonomic nervous system may malfunction.", "Blood pressure may drop dramatically when the person stands, causing dizziness, light-headedness, or fainting - a condition called orthostatic hypotension.", "Blood pressure can increase when the person is lying down.", "People may need to urinate urgently or frequently, or they may leak urine involuntarily (urinary incontinence).", "They may have difficulty emptying the bladder (urinary retention).", "Constipation is common.", "Vision becomes poor.", "Men may have difficulty starting and maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction or erectile dysfunction).", "Other symptoms of autonomic dysfunction may include:", "Decreased production of saliva, tears and saliva.", "Thus, patients may become intolerant to heat, and suffer from dry eyes and mouth.", "People may have difficulty swallowing and breathing.", "Breathing can become noisy and high-pitched.", "And breathing may stop repeatedly or become insufficient during sleep (sleep apnea).", "If REM sleep behavior disorder occurs, patients speak (often obscene), and may wave their arms or legs violently during sleep, possibly because they are dreaming of vivid, frightening dreams and appear to embody it.", "People may lose control of a bowel movement (fecal incontinence).", "Many people are forced to use a wheelchair or become severely disabled within 5 years after symptoms begin.", "This disorder leads to death 9-10 years after symptoms begin.", "The diagnosis", "Doctor evaluation", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Tests to assess the autonomic nervous system", "The diagnosis of multiple systemic atrophy (MSA) is based on the doctor's evaluation and the results of specific tests. For example, doctors may suspect MS if symptoms of Parkinsonism worsen rapidly and levodopa (used to treat Parkinson's disease) has little or no effect on symptoms.", "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually done to check for certain changes in the brain.", "Tests are done to evaluate the autonomic nervous system.", "It includes a thermodynamic sweating test and measuring blood pressure while the person is sitting and after the person is standing, to check for orthostatic hypotension.", "If the MRI shows changes that indicate MS and the test results are abnormal, then it is possible that MSA is present.", "Treatment", "Relieve symptoms", "There is no cure for multiple systemic atrophy.", "However, combining simple measures with medication may help relieve symptoms.", "Parkinsonism: Continuing to do as many daily activities as possible helps maintain muscle strength and flexibility.", "Regular exercise and stretching may also be helpful.", "Drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, such as levodopa and levodopa plus carbidopa, which are used orally, can be tried, but the effect of using this combination is usually slight or its effective effect is limited to a few years.", "Orthostatic hypotension: Measures are taken to stabilize sudden changes in blood pressure.", "Eating extra salt and water might increase blood volume and thus help increase blood pressure.", "Standing slowly may also help prevent a significant or rapid drop in blood pressure when the patient stands, and the use of an abdominal corset or compression stockings may be helpful. This compression equipment helps maintain blood pressure by enhancing blood flow from the legs to the heart, thus preventing too much blood from stagnating (pooling) in the legs.", "Raising the head of the bed by about 10 cm may help prevent a significant increase in blood pressure when the person is lying down.", "Fludrocortisone can be used orally, as it helps the body to retain salt and water, and thus may increase blood pressure if necessary when the patient stands.", "Other medications such as midodrine or droxidopa may also be helped by mouth.", "Decreased production of body fluids: in the event of decreased or no sweating, patients should avoid warm environments to avoid overheating.", "It is imperative that people who suffer from dry mouth take good care of their teeth and adhere to regular checkups.", "Artificial tears (eye drops that contain substances that resemble real tears) every few hours may relieve dry eyes.", "Urinary retention: If necessary, patients can be taught to insert a catheter (thin rubber tube) into the bladder themselves, from which they can insert it several times a day.", "It is inserted through the urethra, allowing urine in the bladder to leak out.", "Then, people remove the catheter after emptying the bladder.", "This procedure helps prevent stretching of the bladder and urinary tract infections.", "Washing hands, cleaning the area around the urethra and using a sterile or clean catheter all help prevent infection.", "The difficulty in inserting a catheter increases as coordination deteriorates.", "Medicines such as bethanechol are sometimes used to stimulate bladder contractions, thereby helping to empty the bladder.", "Urinary incontinence: Oxybutynin, mirabegron, tamsulosin, or tolterodine can be taken by mouth to relax the muscles of an overactive bladder.", "A catheter inserted into the bladder may be helpful when incontinence persists.", "People may learn to insert it themselves.", "Constipation: It is recommended to eat a high-fiber diet and use stool softeners.", "If constipation persists, enemas may be necessary.", "Erectile dysfunction: Treatment usually involves oral administration of drugs such as sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, or avanafil.", "As this disorder progresses, people may need to use a breathing tube, a feeding tube (usually surgically inserted), or both.", "Physical, occupational and speech therapists can teach patients ways to compensate when walking, daily activities and speech become difficult.", "Social workers can help patients find support groups. When symptoms become disabling, they turn to home health care or care homes at the end of life.", "Near-term and end-of-life issues", "Because this disorder is progressive and ultimately fatal, people should prepare directions and a will in advance immediately after diagnosis.", "This will should include the type of medical care patients want at the end of life."]
