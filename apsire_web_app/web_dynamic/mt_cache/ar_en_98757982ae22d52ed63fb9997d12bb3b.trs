[16] In cases of elevated ST segment on the EKG, treatments are recommended that try to restore blood flow to the heart, including coronary angioplasty, which is a non-invasive procedure that pushes arteries to open, or by dissolving clots where the blockage is removed with medication. [7] Patients who have a heart attack without a ST elevation (called this: a heart attack that is not elevated ST) (in English: Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction), known as NSTEMI, are often treated with heparin in order to increase blood flow, but if the patient's condition is at high risk In addition, a catheter is recommended to open the arteries (angioplasty).
