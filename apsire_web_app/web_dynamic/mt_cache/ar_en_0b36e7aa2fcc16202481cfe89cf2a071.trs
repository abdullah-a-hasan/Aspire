["Commentary - The Challenges of COVID-19 in Developing Countries", "Comment 07/08/20 Matthew E Levison, MD, Adjunct Professor of Medicine, Drexel University College of Medicine", "COVID-19 Resource Home Page", "The emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) first struck the richest countries in the world, most likely as a result of the presence of global communication between them that includes the trade and tourism sectors.", "It spread from China to the west coast of the United States in early 2020, and from China to Europe and then to the east coast of the United States.", "These rich countries have shaped global public health responses aimed at limiting interpersonal transmission of the virus through respiratory secretions, which include", "Physical distancing", "Use face masks", "cleaning hands", "Stay home / work from home (where applicable)", "Isolate infected people and quarantine people who have had contact with them", "Schools close", "Economic closure that included the closure of non-essential businesses", "These public health measures have proven effective in richer countries in terms of limiting transmission of the virus and preventing the overwhelming health care systems due to the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases.", "However, implementing these solutions can often be difficult in developing countries.", "People in developing countries often live in overcrowded homes that house people of different generations.", "Also, they may not have the ability to cool food at home, which requires them to go out every day to buy food.", "On the other hand, they may not have access to running water to wash their hands and proper cleaning, and they may not have an Internet connection, or their Internet connection may be so poor that they are unable to study or work from home, and they may lack sufficient savings to support any loss of income (1) .", "They may even have cut off basic supplies that are taken for granted in developed countries, such as soap.", "In some large, wealthy cities in developing countries, millions of poor people live in shantytowns, making it difficult to follow preventive measures designed for developed countries.", "Examples include the favela slums in the Brazilian cities of Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo (2) or the townships of Cape Town and Johannesburg (3).", "In addition, the shortage of equipment required to provide care to Covid-19 patients, such as personal protective equipment, oxygen supply to beds, pulse oximeters, ventilators, the number of ICU beds, and insufficient infection control training among two staff counters Healthcare has many healthcare and public health systems in developing countries.", "For example, there are fewer than two thousand ventilators available to serve hundreds of millions of people in public sector hospitals across 41 African countries (4).", "There is also a chronic shortage of essential supplies.", "These difficulties are compounded by the prevalence of parasitic tropical diseases, malaria, HIV / AIDS, tuberculosis and cholera in these countries.", "Data from the Western Cape in Southern Africa indicate that patients with HIV or TB are at more than twice the risk of dying from COVID-19 (5).", "Conditions in poor and marginalized communities within developing countries are no different.", "The capacity of these communities to absorb the shocks of a pandemic is also much lower. Examples of these communities include the following", "Communities with large numbers of Latin American population groups in the United States, where the prevalence of Covid-19 ranges from 30 to 40%, such as Chelsea, Massachusetts (6)", "Navajo Reserves in New Mexico, where the rate of Covid-19 infections exceeds the rate in New York State (7)", "Unskilled migrant workers in Singapore who number more than 300,000, who live in housing occupied by up to 20 people per room, and who account for more than 90% of Covid-19 injuries in Singapore (8)", "Refugees, internally displaced persons and the homeless who live in camps in the suburbs of cities such as Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, Oakland, Paris, and London, or even in their midst", "Physical distancing is difficult and even impossible for everyone who lives in these circumstances.", "In Africa, which has 1.3 billion people (about 16% of the world's population), it was reported that the Covid-19 pandemic first arrived in Egypt on February 14, 2020, through a Chinese citizen.", "The first confirmed case in sub-Saharan Africa was reported in Nigeria on 27 February 2020, through an Italian national.", "By 26 May 2020, more than half of African countries were experiencing societal transmission of COVID-19.", "Lesotho was the last African country to report a COVID-19 infection on May 13, 2020.", "Since the first Covid-19 infection in Africa in mid-February, the rate of spread of the disease has accelerated increasingly, as it took 98 days to reach the first 100,000 cases, and it only took 18 days to increase to 200,000 cases.", "As of June 20, 2020, Africa reported 3.4% of the approximately 8.5 million total confirmed infections, and 7.2% of the approximately 140,000 new infections reported that day (9).", "However, there are only three African countries, which contain about 55% of the total confirmed cases: namely, South Africa, Egypt and Nigeria.", "These three countries have relatively advanced health systems, indicating the potential for underreporting among many other African countries with less advanced public health systems.", "South Africa, Egypt and Nigeria occupy the first, second, and third ranks in terms of increasing the number of injuries per 24 hours.", "The number of injuries in these three countries is increasing steadily, doubling every two weeks.", "Let us take South Africa as an example of the difficulties that must be overcome in developing countries. It is noticeable that about 80% of South Africa's population of more than 58 million are of black descent, and most black adults still live in towns dating back to the time of apartheid (10). They are densely populated towns.", "People live in small makeshift homes built of corrugated sheets and metal sheets, less than one meter apart, and often use bathrooms and public water faucets, each of which uses between 30 and 40 people a day (11).", "These factors make it difficult for townspeople to comply with social distancing conditions.", "In addition, many townspeople hold basic jobs abroad, especially in city hospitals and provide food, and they often have to travel long distances every day on public transport to go to work (12, 13).", "The first COVID-19 cases in South Africa involved people who had sufficient financial means to travel abroad.", "The first patient known to have contracted COVID-19 in South Africa was a man who tested positive for the virus upon his return from Italy on March 5, 2020.", "By 11 March, six new infections had been reported, one from the same travel group that visited Italy, while the other five had traveled to other European countries.", "On 15 March, the first local outbreaks were reported.", "The number of injuries rose to 150 on 19 March, before it reached 554 in just five days.", "A month after recording the first injury, the number of injuries reached 1500; Then this number began to double every 10 to 14 days, until it reached more than 92 thousand in total, almost on June 21, 2020.", "It is difficult to know the extent of COVID-19 infections in towns from official monitoring reports.", "The South African National Institute of Transmitted Diseases only disaggregates infection numbers by age, gender, and county (14).", "As of June 22, 2020, the Western Cape Province (which includes Cape Town, the second-most populous country) is the epicenter of the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa, with 53% of cumulative infections recorded at the national level, followed by the province Gauteng (which includes all of Johannesburg, the most populous city, and Pretoria, its administrative capital) by 21%.", "The Western Cape Provincial Government website divides the numbers of infections by region, and by the eight health subregions within Cape Town, namely, the Eastern Province, the Western Province, the Northern Territory, the Southern Province, and the Kailitsha, Klipfontein, Taegerberg and Mitchell Lippen Provinces (15); Cape Town is the province's hotspot, with 78% of injuries in the state.", "A third of Cape Town's population of 3.7 million live in towns (16), according to news reports that it is a hotspot for Covid-19 infections within the city (Kailitsha, Klebfontein and Donon in the Western Province, Haut-Bee in the Southern Province, and Mitchell Blaine) , As in the \"working class\" areas of Tijerberg (17, 18).", "Southern African officials moved quickly to contain the spread of COVID-19.", "At the end of March, the country was imposed the most stringent full lockdown regimes in the world.", "In many towns, during this period, residents were only allowed to go to work in the \"basic services\" sector, to obtain health care, to receive social grants, to attend small funerals (of which there were no more than 50 people), and to purchase essential goods. .", "The easing of restrictions began on May 1, 2020, while South Africa was reporting fewer than 500 injuries per day; But by early June, there were reports of between 1,000 and over 2,000 new infections per day.", "But due to the economic downturn, the government has chosen to continue easing lockdown measures, despite the rapidly increasing number of infections.", "About one billion people, or 32 percent of the urban population of the world, live in \"informal settlements\" under overcrowded and unfulfilled living conditions (for example, southern African towns), most of which are located in the developing world (19) .", "However, interventions to prevent the spread of Covid-19, such as physical distancing, which have performed well in resource-rich settings are impractical in these circumstances, either in South Africa (1), or in other resource-limited countries, or even in specific sections of some rich cities. Located in developed countries.", "Correcting the overcrowding conditions in those areas will be difficult, but Singapore has immediately begun to reduce the population density in the current housing it provides to its displaced workforce, and is in the process of rethinking its future housing projects (20).", "The South African government is said to be intending to \u201cabolish the population density\u201d of \u201cinformal settlements\u201d 21.", "Whenever possible, the process of changing living conditions in \"informal settlements\" such as towns, favelas, and camps for the displaced should be implemented in cooperation with community-based organizations working in these areas in order to increase the likelihood of the effectiveness of any measures taken.", "In addition, home stay policies during the COVID-19 pandemic have put the lives of many people who depend on daily income to support their families.", "Due to the negative economic impacts of the complete shutdown, having a major impact on socially and economically disadvantaged communities, important components of the pandemic response plans include food rations and financial assistance (11)."]
