["Putting the Emirati-Israeli agreement in its proper context", "Question: What is at the same time something bigger and smaller than it appears at first glance?", "Answer: The announcement in August of full normalization of relations between the UAE and Israel, which was arranged through the good offices of the United States.", "I am a huge fan of the agreement between the UAE and Israel, which will open up opportunities for cooperation, partnership and synergy between the most dynamic and forward-looking economies in the Middle East.", "I'm not a big fan of the misconceptions that filled the airwaves and opening pages in the days since the news was announced.", "Therefore, it is necessary to verify what it means - and what it does not mean - actually the Emirati-Israeli agreement.", "On the one hand, I think the agreement is \"bigger\" than what many admit.", "It represents a major and shocking change in Arab-Israeli relations and came to put an end to 72 years of Arab states that do not share borders with Israel to reconcile with the Jewish state.", "From Morocco to Oman, these countries have maintained varying degrees of distancing, under the pretext of loyalty to the Palestinian cause.", "In fact, many of them were able to maintain their isolation, precisely because Israel provided many of the economic, agricultural, hydrological, security and intelligence benefits of the bilateral relations through secret channels, without the Arab side having to establish formal diplomatic relations with it in return.", "Now that the UAE has paved the way, pressure will be applied in two directions.", "First, the 18 Arab states will release the opposition under pressure to explain what specifically prevents them, in the context of their commitment to the Palestinian cause, from enjoying the additional benefits provided by full normal relations with Israel that the UAE clearly believes will be accompanied by full normalization.", "Second, there will be pressure on Israel to deny its friendly Arab countries the benefit of secret friendly meetings after the precedent set for legitimizing their relations.", "Debate still rages on another aspect of the Emirati-Israeli agreement that might make it even \"bigger\" than it appears - the fact that the agreement constitutes a \"linkage\" to achieving Arab-Israeli peace.", "Wasl is a concept that Israeli leaders have been fighting since the birth of the modern \"peace process\" nearly fifty years ago.", "Indeed, one of the great paradoxes in the agreement with the UAE is that Benjamin Netanyahu - the heir of the two hard-line leaders from the revisionist movement Ze'ev Jabotinsky and Menachem Begin, and the planner for the idea of unilateral Israeli annexation of occupied territories in the June 1967 war - is the Israeli leader responsible for reintroducing them. The link \"to the equation of the peace process.", "Since the first disengagement agreement between Egypt and Israel after the October 1973 war, Israeli leaders have wanted to separate their emerging state-level relations with Arab capitals from their internal sectarian conflict with the Palestinians.", "During the Labor Party era, Golda Meir and then Yitzhak Rabin benefited from their agreement reluctantly to cede territories to Egypt and Syria in exchange for US commitments not to deal with the Palestine Liberation Organization, except under harsh conditions.", "In 1979, Begin effectively succeeded in reaching a completely separate peace with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, officially disengaging peace with a major state and the conflict with the Palestinians.", "After the \"Oslo Accords\" in 1993, Shimon Peres revived what could be called \"the soft link\" by planning the \"Casablanca Process\" for economic relations with Arab countries to build on the good intentions of the agreement between Israel and the \"Palestine Liberation Organization\", but that effort failed When the \"Oslo Accords\" lost their luster.", "But by specifically agreeing to suspend steps toward annexing the West Bank as part of the normalization agreement with the UAE, it was Netanyahu who once again entered the direct engagement in a bilateral agreement with an Arab country.", "In theory, the idea that Israel would reap the benefits of regional relations from the concessions it made to the Palestinians has been on the table since the Saudis proposed the \"Arab Peace Initiative\" in 2002, which promised full-fledged relations with all Arab states (and thus, Islamic countries). Versus the illusion of full Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 borders.", "But the agreement with the UAE put the matter in its real size, turning a hypothetical possibility into a tangible reality.", "Additional demands?", "Now that the prime minister from the Likud Party has endorsed the principle of Israel agreeing to the demands of the Arab countries far from it regarding matters related to the Palestinians in exchange for establishing full relations with them, it is not unreasonable to expect additional demands from other Arab countries that are considering normalizing relations with Jerusalem.", "This raises a series of provocative questions.", "Is Israel, for example, considering restricting the growth of settlements in the West Bank or transferring additional lands to Palestinian control in exchange for formalizing relations with other major Arab states, such as Morocco, or groups of states, such as the smaller Gulf states?", "And no less important, will the Palestinian leadership give up its opposition to the emerging wave of Arab normalization with Israel, which reflects negatively on it and cooperates with Arab capitals to increase the benefits that it can get from this new development?", "Alternatively, Israel may try to exploit its reluctance to annexation to normalize relations with other Arab states.", "In this case, the decision will be in the hands of Arab states that want to get closer to Jerusalem - does this \u201crecycled link\u201d provide sufficient cover to benefit from the overt fruits of bilateral relations?", "Specifically, the likelihood and evolution of the link in the emerging relations between Israel and the Arab countries is one of the most important questions - and certainly one of the most interesting - resulting from the achievement of the UAE.", "Regardless of the importance of the Emirati-Israeli agreement, it is in certain respects smaller than it appears as well.", "But this does not diminish the significance of the essence of this achievement or the intention of the two parties to the agreement - whether the pioneering leader of the UAE, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, or Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who reaped significant gains from efforts during his tenure as president of several governments to expand global reach to Israel.", "Instead, it must be realized what should be clear - that establishing fully normal relations is, for both, a choice, not a necessity.", "Depending on the circumstances, both can move away from this option without experiencing a major strategic change.", "In this regard, the UAE differs from Egypt or Jordan, which needed peace with Israel to meet the basic existential challenges - for Anwar Sadat, the need to regain the territories and, through peace, reorient Egypt to the West; For King Hussein, the need to protect Hashemite rights in the wake of the sudden agreement between Israel and the \"Palestine Liberation Organization\" in Oslo.", "Likewise, today's Israel - strong, vibrant, and self-assured - is not the same Israel that reluctantly returned every inch of Sinai in order to eject Egypt from the Arab war coalition or which provided the Hashemite Kingdom with a contractual guarantee for its role in Jerusalem in order to restrict Jordan by agreement. Long term to protect its security borders at the Jordan River.", "There is no common border between Israel and the UAE, no territorial conflict, and no existential or ideological boundary covering overt reconciliation.", "Both of them will undoubtedly reap significant benefits from the normalization agreement between them, but none of these benefits will come close to the strategic importance that Egypt and Jordan gained through peace treaties with the Jewish state - and vice versa.", "The common denominator of the Emirates with Egypt and Jordan is the fact that the UAE will gain significant benefits from its agreement with Israel regarding relations with Washington.", "In the field of technology, the UAE will gain access to high-tech weapons, which would otherwise be restricted due to concerns that their delivery would undermine Israel's qualitative military superiority.", "In terms of politics, the UAE is gaining a measure of immunity from the tougher policy toward Arab authoritarian regimes that Democrats are likely to adopt, if Joe Biden wins the US presidency in November - not full immunity, of course, but Arab leaders who are at peace with Israel enjoys a different status from the Arab leaders who are not at peace with Israel.", "On these two main issues - access to advanced technology and protection from criticism of the UAE's interventions in Yemen and Libya - merely adopting a policy of openness in the UAE's relations with Israel may not be enough. Instead, as is often the case with Cairo and Amman, it may take the constant advocacy of Israeli, pro-Israel representatives in the US House of Representatives and Senate to provide political protection for the Emiratis, who likely believe they gained it from normalization.", "But there is an important difference that represents a basic corollary to all of this: Specifically, since the strategic stakes are much lower for the two parties to the Emirati-Israeli agreement compared to Israel's other Arab peace partners, the cost incurred by either side in the event of a break in relations will be much less than the price. The consequences of Egypt or Jordan severing their relations with Israel.", "It is not difficult to envision a scenario in which the Emiratis freeze or reverse some aspects of normalization - in response to some particularly unacceptable Israeli steps towards the Palestinians, for example, or in the event that Israel and post-Erdogan Turkey decide to conclude a reconciliation agreement.", "But the geographical distance separating Israel from the UAE is important.", "The UAE could reduce its relations, withdraw its ambassador, and impose restrictions on Israeli tourists, yet the two countries will be able to deal with the repercussions. As for Egypt and Jordan - which did this at times throughout the period during which they maintained peace with Israel - they have more bets in relations with their neighbor Israel and may face more serious repercussions (it must be noted that this phenomenon works in both directions).", "Benefits and risks", "For its part, Israel will enjoy great benefits from its normal relations with the Emirates, both in terms of the bilateral opportunities that it can develop with welcome entrepreneurs in an influential Gulf state that has proven, just like Israel, its presence on the international stage, and in terms of the impact that the expansion of relations may have. With other Arab and Islamic countries.", "But formalizing relations with the UAE does not dispel or even fundamentally change any of the other strategic challenges that Israel faces - whether that be the nuclear threat from Iran, the missile threat from quasi-state actors on its borders, or the bi-national threat from the conflict that has arisen. It is not resolved with the Palestinians.", "As with the UAE, for Israel as well, the risks of normal relations are less than those with former peace partners.", "The opposition caused by the Emirati-Israeli agreement among its enemies will be one of the areas in which others will determine the impact of the agreement.", "One must remember that Egypt suffered from ostracism and boycott by the Arab world for a decade due to the peace treaty it concluded alone with Israel, but in the end these countries reconciled with Cairo according to the conditions set by Cairo and not other countries.", "Since then, many Arab countries have hosted senior Israeli ministers, trade missions and Israeli sports teams, without encountering little resistance even from extremists in the region.", "In this respect, times have indeed changed.", "Turkey and Iran were two of the most vocal critics of the Emirati-Israeli deal - ironically, they are two non-Arab Muslim states who were Israel's closest partners in the region at the start of the peace process, but it is clear that they have radically changed their approach since then.", "The main question that arises is whether their dissatisfaction with the agreement will take a more fundamental form and will not remain mere criticisms of their favorite satellite channels.", "Given the strength of the Israeli and Emirati economies, boycotts by critics of the Jerusalem-Abu Dhabi partnership will be ineffective and likely to harm the boycotters more than the targeted victims.", "What matters is whether Israeli and Emirati assets - especially symbols of their partnership, such as embassies, joint ventures, airlines, and tourist sites - will become the target of terrorist attacks that will be carried out by Tehran, Ankara, and their local proxies such as Hezbollah and Hamas.", "Even if this happens, we should not immediately conclude that anger over the Emirati-Israeli agreement was the main driver in itself.", "Given the rivalries and enmities sweeping the region from Libya to the Gulf, it may be difficult to know whether this new Arab-Israeli partnership is the direct cause of any specific move or just the more accessible excuse.", "Finally, the Emirati-Israeli agreement is \"smaller\" than what public opinion perceives in terms of the American role.", "To be sure, the Trump administration deserves great praise for realizing that expanding the circle of peace in the Middle East by establishing full-fledged relations between the UAE and Israel may benefit American interests much more than blessing Israel's disastrous move aimed at annexing territories in the West Bank, and then exerting vigorous efforts with a view to Reaching a normalization agreement.", "But the possibility of that disaster stems from President Trump's short-sighted promise he made in January to recognize the territories that Israel might annex under his peace plan, and which was followed by the administration's refusal to backtrack on this frivolous offer.", "Indeed, it seems that the US President's advisor, Jared Kushner, has personally realized that the Emirati-Israeli agreement is, among other things, a way to thwart that American initiative when he wrote, in a very frankly implicit review, an editorial in the \"Washington Post\" newspaper praising the UAE agreement - Without specifically mentioning Trump's peace plan.", "Netanyahu was handed over", "Like all good political decisions, the Emirati-Israeli agreement is a product of the enlightened self-interests of the two main parties.", "The Trump administration realized that Israel's annexation of land in the West Bank would appear to be the final nail in the coffin of Trump's peace plan, and the administration was open to any means to help Netanyahu back off his commitment to the annexation to avoid this political embarrassment.", "(The idea, presented by some analysts, that the annexation process was a clever trick by Netanyahu to provide support for the normalization agreement is a particularly wrong idea, as if Kushner did not address the petitions of the American ambassador David Friedman or if the number of people infected with the Coronavirus in Israel did not increase dangerously and it was decided to write off The annexation item is part of its political agenda. All indications would have pointed to the fact that Netanyahu is moving forward with his political promise to achieve annexation.)", "The Emiratis have realized that they could benefit greatly from this American administration and its potential successor if they intervened to extend a helping hand to Netanyahu to withdraw from the annexation issue.", "Netanyahu himself came to the conclusion that the practical benefits of normalization with a prominent Gulf state outweigh the ideological satisfaction with the annexation process, a reality that has gained more importance with the increase in Joe Biden's electoral fortunes (in the US presidency) in recent months, which increased the possibility that the annexation would cause a rhythm in the relationship. Extremely important with Washington.", "The outcome should not be exaggerated or underestimated - the establishment of normal relations between the UAE and Israel is not a moment of a global shift in the regional balance of power, nor is it merely the product of an inevitable development of relations that were previously secret, additional information in the lines of history, which is quickly forgotten. .", "Rather, it must be recognized that it is a landmark event that is a very important step from a practical and psychological point of view, albeit still gradually in a process that began more than 100 years ago towards legitimizing the idea of a Jewish state in the Middle East.", "Indeed, the voluntary nature that does not betray the need of this partnership leads to a special celebration of it."]
