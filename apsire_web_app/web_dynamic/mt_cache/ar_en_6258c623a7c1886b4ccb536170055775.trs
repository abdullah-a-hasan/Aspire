["Lebanon: School officials beat children", "(Beirut, May 13, 2019) - In a report published today, Human Rights Watch said that Lebanon's ban on school personnel to prevent them from hitting students, verbally abusing them, or causing them pain in any way in the name of discipline is often ignored.", "The 59-page report, \u201cI Don't Want My Son to Strike: Corporal Punishment in Lebanese Schools,\u201d found that children suffer corporal punishment in schools due to the lack of accountability for perpetrators.", "Lebanon should enforce the long-imposed ban on corporal punishment, Human Rights Watch said, and suggested ways in which the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, with the help of international funders, could end these violations.", "\u201cCorporal punishment has been prohibited in Lebanese schools for decades,\u201d said Bill Van Esveld, Senior Researcher in the Children's Rights Division. \u201cHowever, students are still forced to choose between suffering from abuse and being denied an education.", "Adults beat children in Lebanese schools, and the need to remedy the matter is urgent. \"", "The report found, based on documented cases of 51 children - in private and public (government) schools in all Lebanese regions - who had been subjected to violence, that common punishment includes insults, insults, slaps in the face or hit on the hands.", "Some students also reported more severe forms of abuse, such as beatings with sticks, rubber tubes and electric wires.", "In some cases of alleged \"discipline\", the situation escalated into serious assault and caused harm.", "A teacher hit a student with a book in the face and broke him years of age just because he asked to go to the bathroom.", "While another student said that his teacher hit him on the hands with an electric wire, leaving a wound in them, \"He kept bleeding for two or three days.\"", "A student's father said that a teacher hit his daughter \"hard\" on the face until it became \"like a tomato\" even after she returned home a few hours later.", "The school staff did not inform the student's parents about what happened in any of the documented cases.", "The Ministry of Education has banned corporal punishment since the 1970s, and since 2014 the Lebanese penal code no longer protects school personnel assault on students.", "However, school officials often respond to parents' complaints in this regard, and in some cases teachers or administrators beat the student or student a second time in retaliation.", "In some cases, parents filed complaints with the police, but to no avail.", "The Ministry of Education did not refer any of the cases documented in the report to a criminal investigation.", "An eyewitness: An eyewitness was assaulted in class due to his illness", "Corporal punishment can cause short-term pain and suffering and long-term harm.", "In an article published in 2018, 4 Lebanese pediatricians said that they found that corporal punishment may push children toward \"hostility, criminality and domestic violence later in their lives,\" in addition to antisocial behavior, anxiety disorders and other problems such as depression and suicidal tendencies.", "In contrast, \"no study has shown a positive effect of corporal punishment in the long term.\"", "A student faced difficulties in his lessons because of the side effects of the cancer treatment he was undergoing, so the teacher insulted him, pulled him by his hair, and kicked him out of class instead of helping him.", "Another teacher broke the nose of a student after he asked why she was beating his classmate.", "She transferred the student's mother to another school due to her dissatisfaction with the school's decision, which only suspended the teacher temporarily from work.", "The mother added that it took her son more than a month in the new school to believe that not all of the teachers were like the ones that hit him.", "Human Rights Watch found that Syrian refugee children may be more vulnerable than others to abuse in a political climate charged with xenophobia.", "Syrian children said that school staff insulted their nationality, in addition to beating them, and in many cases prevented them from using the bathroom.", "All Syrian families in one of the areas receiving refugees refrained from sending their children to a local public school for a week in early 2018 due to the violations, until the school caved in and promised to end the beatings and allow children to use the bathroom.", "The Ministry of Education warned in 2014 that \"already approved corporal punishment may encourage teachers who are not sufficiently trained to use violence\" as the number of Syrian students rises, citing a United Nations assessment saying that 70 percent of students, in all Lebanese regions, have been subjected to violent discipline.", "In 2018, the number of Lebanese and Syrian students was roughly equal, with 210,000 each.", "The Ministry of Education has established a hotline and a referral system for complaints of violence in schools.", "But the families said they were given little information, if any, about how the cases were being handled and whether or not they were addressed.", "One of the families who filed a complaint said that the school administration threatened to hand her over to the police if she insisted on the complaint.", "Like most Syrian refugees in Lebanon, this family does not have legal residency in Lebanon.", "In May 2018, the Ministry of Education launched a comprehensive policy to protect children in schools, which renewed the ban on corporal punishment.", "This policy is a positive step and will be implemented in all schools by 2020, Human Rights Watch said.", "But the ministry should give priority to law enforcement in order to be able to end corporal punishment.", "In practice, complaints mechanisms must be improved; Disseminating information about complaints received by the Ministry, the results of investigations into them, and how to punish the violation; Work with NGOs to follow up on the issue; Ensure that all teachers have adequate training.", "The ministry should declare its commitment to following up on complaints in which the name of the complainant is hidden, to ensure that parents and students feel that they can complain safely.", "The ministry should agree on methods that keep information about children confidential, and allow information about complaints to be shared with NGOs that have the resources and expertise that the education system lacks to follow up on cases.", "\u201cProfessors need adequate training in disciplining children without using violence,\u201d Van Esveld said.", "Children need an educational system that preserves their right to an education without fear.", "With logical reforms, Lebanon can end corporal punishment in schools. \""]
